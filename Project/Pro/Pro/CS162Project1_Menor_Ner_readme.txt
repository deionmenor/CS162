This program simulates the various kinds of process scheduling algorithms.
The input is as follows:
The first line is the number of testcases, each testcase begins with a line that
indicates the number of processes to schedule and what algorithm to use
Ex. 10 FCFS
The rest of the lines describe the processes, with each line having 3 numbers
indicating the arrival time, the burst time, and the priority of the task

The output starts with a number indicating the testcase.
Each succeeding line before the next testcase shows the current time elapsed,
what process is running, and how much cpu time is used to run that process.
If a process is finished, the line ends with an X.

Afterwards, the program will output the criteria of the scheduling algorithms. such as
CPU Utilization, Throughput, and Response, Waiting, and Turnaround time

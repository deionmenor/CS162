This code simulates the assembly code generated by the c++ code instructions for multiplying an arbitrary number by 19, -2, and 0.
The user inputs a number and the program outputs that number multiplied by the three previously mentioned multipliers.
The assembly code for each instruction can be found as a comment in the .cpp file.

This C++ program runs a stack data structure implemented with a linked-list. Each Node in the stack contains an int variable data as well as a pointer to the next node in the stack. The IntStack struct has command push and pop which allow us to add and retrieve data from the stack. The main method initializes an IntStack and runs an arbitrary sequence of pushes and pops, followed by deletion.
